Neighborhood Blog Catalog
=========================

Overview
--------
A simple `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/>` application which serves
a user-contributable directory of neighborhood blogs. It is a submission for
Project 3 in `Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Developer Nanodegree <https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004>`.
This project, although functional, was built mostly for self-learning purposes.
I am currently working on getting it up and running on Heroku
`here <neighborhood-blogs-app.herokuapp.com>`.
