#Neighborhood Blog Catalog

A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/) application which serves a user-contributable directory of neighborhood blogs. It is a submission for Project 3 in [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

This project is a work-in-progress. Currently, the basic database layout is built, with the additional `lotsofblogs.py` file containing the initial blogs to
populate the database.
