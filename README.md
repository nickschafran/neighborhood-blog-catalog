#Neighborhood Blog Catalog

##About:
A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/) application which serves a user-contributable directory of neighborhood blogs. It is a submission for Project 3 in [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). This project, although functional, was built mostly for self-learning purposes. I am currently working on getting it up and running on Heroku [here](neighborhood-blogs-app.herokuapp.com).

##Instructions:
To build application:

1. Run `database_setup.py` to create the sqlalchemy database.
2. Run `lotsofblogs.py` to populate the database with the initial list of blogs.
3. Run `application.py` to run the Flask application on `localhost:5000`.

Note: In order for authentication and authorization methods to work properly, a [Google](console.developers.google.com) client ID and client secret must be provided. I have not included mine in the public repository; to run the application you may provide your own in the `client_secrets.json` placeholder text.
