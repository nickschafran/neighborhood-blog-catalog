#Neighborhood Blog Catalog

##About:
A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/) application which serves a user-contributable directory of neighborhood blogs. It is a submission for Project 3 in [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). This project, although functional, was built mostly for self-learning purposes.

##Instructions:
To build application:

1. Run `database_setup.py` to create the sqlalchemy database.
2. Run `lotsofblogs.py` to populate the database with the initial list of blogs.
3. Run `application.py` to run the Flask application on `localhost:5000`.
