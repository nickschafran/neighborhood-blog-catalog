#Neighborhood Blog Catalog

A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/) application which serves a user-contributable directory of neighborhood blogs. It is a submission for Project 3 in [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

This project is a work-in-progress. Currently, the basic functionality to create
, read, update, and delete blogs and the neighborhoods by which they are categor
ized is in place, along with the additional `lotsofblogs.py` file containing the initial items to populate the database. I am currently working on authorizat
ion and API functionality.
